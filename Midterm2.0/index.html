<h4>You’ve likely heard that Taylor Swift recently completed the U.S.-based
first leg of her Eras Tour, but have you heard about the impact that tour
had on local communities and economies across the United States? We lay it
out below.</h4>

<p>Setting the stage: Concerts, professional sports games and other major
events—and the large number of out-of-town visitors they attract—have
always provided an economic boost to host cities, bringing in an influx of
customers to businesses that cater to travelers.
While the economic impact of every event depends on multiple factors, a
commonly used multiplier is that $100 spent on live performances generates
about $300 in other expenses including spending on hotels, food and
transportation.</p>

<p>Unprecedented impact: Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour went to 20 U.S. cities, and
the concertgoers far outpaced typical spending patterns. Swift fans––
“Swifties”––averaged $1,300 of spending in local economies on travel,
hotel stays, food, as well as merchandise and costumes.
That amount of spending is on par with the Super Bowl, but this time it
happened on 53 different nights in 20 different locations over the course
of five months. Downtowns across the country have enjoyed an influx of
visitors—and a spending boost thanks to Taylor Swift.</p>

<p>Total Economic Impact: A well-cited study by Question Pro, calculates that
Swifties have already directly spent around $5 billion in destinations
around the country. U.S. Travel has confirmed that––though referred to as
economic impact––this is a lowball figure, which carefully adds up direct
spending by fans.</p>

<p>We believe that the total economic impact likely exceeded $10 billion. The
total economic impact includes indirect spending as well as spending by
others who came to join the action around the events but did not actually
attend the shows.</p>

<p>Localized impact: While many attendees were local, each concert also drew
a significant number of visitors who in addition to attending the concert,
spent multiple days in the destination. Cities around the country
experienced record high occupancy rates and bustling downtowns over the
concert weekends.</p>


<h5>Here’s a look at the local impact on some of the cities in the tour:</h5>
<p>Pittsburgh’s two concerts generated $46 million in direct spending, with
83% of those attending the concerts coming from outside Alleghany County.
Hotel occupancy––the highest weekend occupancy post pandemic and the
second highest weekend occupancy on recor––averaged at 95% and pushed
average daily room rates (ADR) to $309, a 106% increase.</p>


<p>Los Angeles—which hosted six shows that marked the end of the first part
of the tour—benefited from a total economic impact of $320 million, with
3,300 jobs created, $20 million in sales and local sales tax and another
$9 million in hotel room taxes.</p>

<p>Denver’s two concerts resulted in visitor spending that contributed an
estimated $140 million to the state’s GDP.</p>

<p>Cincinnati’s impact was estimated at $48 million, of which $20 million was
from out of town guests.</p>

<p>What else: With 53 U.S. concerts so far, Taylor Swift’s shows may have
produced the strongest economic impact for a concert tour. But when it
comes to average spending per show, Question Pro shared that concertgoers
of another tour, Beyonce’s Renaissance Tour, have even exceeded Swifties’
spending by $300, with an average spending that exceeded $1,800! These
fans also have produced an economic impact in the billions of dollars.</p>

<div class="callout customCallout">
<p>Why it matters: Swift and Beyonce fans are the most recent eventgoers to
have demonstrated the power of events in driving travel to destinations,
and in doing so, contributing to and boosting local economies. Concerts,
sporting games and large-scale events provide incredible opportunities for
cities to showcase themselves and hopefully drive repeat visitation.
The bottom line: Travel is an economic engine, which supports businesses
and communities each and every day.</p></div>
