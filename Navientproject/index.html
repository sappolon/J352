<h1>Increase in complaint ID's regarding student loans from Apr '21 to May '23 in California<h1>

<h4>By Sofia Appolonio</h4>

<h5>The state of California saw a 3 million user increase in complaint ID's from April 2021 to May 2023 for Federal Student Loans, according to data provided by The Navient Coorporation</h5>

<p>The data below displays a sharp increase in the ammount of complaint IDs regarding Federal Student Loan servicing, with many user's claiming that the issue with their loan related to poor information on the loan from Navient or issues with how the payments were handled.</p>

<p>users of the programm added that the customer service response and representitives of the company were often little help, with many not even responding to the claims.</p>

<iframe title="[ Increase in complaint IDs between Apr '21 and Mar &quot;23]" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-ZR8MS" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ZR8MS/4/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="410" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();</script>

  <p>Representatives of Navient said that many clients closed their complaint with an explanation of their situation or with a monetary response.</p>

  <p>In my initial observations of the data, it was evident that the glaring issue in this company is misinformation and missmanagement of data for customers in order for them to learn about their loan and loan options. However, the vast majority of responses the company either validated with a  response of monotary compensation.</p>
